# Simple app that provides Single Sign On for Discourse

# TODO:
- Figure out how to migrate users from Discourse to SSO
- Check if users can sign in to Discourse if email is not confirmed. Fix it if so.
- Extract Discourse SSO logic to some class?
- Add avatars later?
- Add name, username to user
- Ability to update user profile, sync with discourse
- Ability to log out / handle discourse logs out
- How to test it?
- Check suppress_welcome_message, could be useful.
